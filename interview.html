        <p>Curatorial Statement by Katherine Behar</p>

          "Every artwork is a reenactment, a time machine, a fantasy, something
          terribly true and spectacularly fictional."

          The New Media Artspace is proud to present
          <em>
            Kerry Downey: This is a reenactment but this time it will be
            different
          </em>
          , a solo exhibition of single-channel videos and two-dimensional
          elements that reflect this New York-based artist's interdisciplinary
          process. Focusing on reenactment alludes to how performance undergirds
          Downey's manifold practice, as well as to the genre of historical
          reenactment by which seemingly fixed hegemonic narratives can be
          resuscitated and reimagined in the present. Reenactment opens spaces
          for infiltrating received histories, both personal and political, and
          for torquing them toward alternate horizons of inclusion and justice.
          Downey's reenactments veer again and again toward the possibility of
          something "different."
          <em>This is a reenactment but this time it will be different</em>
          brings together videos (in-person and online), prints (online only),
          and artifacts of their research-intensive practice (in-person only).
          Across these works, Downey's reenactments inhabit, mimic, and shape
          the forms and materials of their surround, and their position in
          relation to them. Immersing themself in abandoned spaces and
          materials, they queer the relation of form to history and of person to
          place in matters of political positioning. Their moving images move us
          between the fictional, the possible, and the true.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The exhibition begins with <em>What we came to see</em>. A voice
          narrates a pilgrimage to visit a collection of now-dilapidated
          monuments constructed during Tito's era and commissioned by local
          towns throughout the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
          The narrator, we learn, is an artist who "came to see" the derelict
          monuments after recognizing that a chance encounter with one monument
          years prior had been a formative experience, resonating with her
          present-day art practice. The monuments welcome viewers to climb into
          their architectural forms, rewarding those who do with an otherwise
          unattainable view of their surroundings. She now strives to recreate
          the monuments' invitation to inhabit a viewpoint in her own
          sculptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrator's voice does not belong to Kerry Downey, but rather to a
          friend. Nevertheless-and despite not having visited these sites-Downey
          is an active presence as an editor reconstructing photographic
          documentation of the trip and their friend's voiceover to develop
          meaning as the video unfolds. It presents Downey's computer screen
          intensely zoomed in, obsessively panning the photographic surfaces. In
          a momentary zoom out, Downey reveals a figure poised aloft in a
          concrete hole, arms goofily extended to mime the gentle slope of a
          hilly horizon line. This visitor is reenacting the form of a place in
          the distance-a place they aren't-as a means of bodily connecting with
          it. This image does not stay on screen for long; soon overtaken by
          another zoom, it evaporates into nondescript pixels (until, that is,
          the image is reenacted in another artwork, <em>Nothing but net</em>,
          when Downey performs the same gesture to match the contour of a
          projected abstract shape). Even as Downey's friend recollects their
          journey, Downey's searching manipulations of the pictures-scrutinizing
          pixels that remain only pixels-implies a hunger for more than or more
          to the story. By zooming, panning, scrolling, and repositioning,
          Downey keeps the still image-and the story that manifests across its
          surface-restlessly moving.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrator offers a clue as to why-or better yet how-we could say
          "Kerry Downey's moving image works." Unlike many Western political
          monuments that place viewers at or below the feet of heroic
          patriarchs, toward whom they can only passively gaze up, these
          enticing structures solicit participation and embodied involvement.
          Being bodily in the mix goes beyond reframing the landscape; it also
          reframes the modality of political participation. If
          <em>What we came to see </em>suggests a queering of monumentality and
          political subjecthood, Downey reenacts that queering when they
          themself get into the image, and get the image moving.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What we came to see</em>
          offers a cypher for many of the artist's other works. Downey describes
          their usual process as flowing between two-dimensional printmaking,
          drawing, and painting, and four-dimensional time-based performance art
          and video works. For example, the second video in the exhibition,
          <em>Nothing but net</em>, is staged on and with an overhead projector.
          The action unfolds on the projector's surface or in its beam, where
          Downey transforms the basic elements of their practice-ink, paper,
          their own body-into an otherworldly landscape. The voiceover is a long
          poem that articulates tensions between being and becoming:
        </p>
        <p>This is a reenactment but this time it will be different.</p>
        <p>This is the pressure of bearing between</p>
        <p>
          moving closer while further away
          <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The work begins with something like primordial ooze. Seeping black ink
          becomes something celestial, uncontrollable, as the sound of breathing
          emits an aura of perpetual expansion and retraction. Eventually, these
          liquid forms give way to solid shapes, colored cut paper shapes that
          reappear in Downey's accompanying print works. Downey themself
          eventually appears amid the colored shapes, first as hand in shadow
          and ultimately in a "STAFF" cap lit by the projector's glow. Bathing
          in image, they point to an excess that cannot be contained by a still
          image or words alone. This work unfolds, as the voiceover suggests,
          "where the sense suffers the word."<a
            href="#_edn3"
            name="_ednref3"
            title=""
            ><sup>3</sup></a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          As is common for Downey's practice, unique monotype prints accompany
          this video, and the video itself is produced by projecting through
          plexiglass plates used to produce the prints. While both arise from
          the same process, the still images appear self-contained, unlike the
          moving images that evoke what Downey calls a "tension between the
          video frame and something that clearly exceeds the frame, like smoke
          or entropy."
          <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> Downey's
          visual language momentarily coheres in these still images, combining
          symbols, shapes, and abstract compositions. The prints are purposeful,
          but their meanings remain private. Abstraction enables Downey to build
          a personal lexicon of shape-symbols that deflect what they call the
          "violences of being looked at but not seen."<a
            href="#_edn5"
            name="_ednref5"
            title=""
            ><sup>5</sup></a
          >
          The danger of being misunderstood or misplaced is acute for Downey as
          a genderqueer artist. Their bodily vulnerability as a performer in
          their moving images contrasts with the inscrutable symbolic vernacular
          of their print works.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in <em>Wormholes</em>, Downey's most recent video work
          appearing third in the exhibition, Downey shows themself attempting to
          merge into diverse settings often overflowing with overwhelming
          quantities of refuse materials or showing signs of neglect. In
          <em>Wormholes</em>, Downey's reuse of art materials extends to their
          own previous artworks, and even themself. <em>Wormholes</em> recuts
          footage from over a decade's work, a project Downey was inspired to
          undertake when they were struck by similarities across their archive,
          as though each project reenacts a recurring dynamic. Describing the
          making of this video, they refer to themself as a material, too. "As I
          started reconfiguring these videos, I was playing with different
          experiences of time and cutting up images of myself, past versions of
          me."
          <a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Wormholes </em>
          stitches together moments across time when Downey assimilates themself
          into a particular setting. They use quotidian techniques of material
          immersion and camouflage, like hiding, reflecting, disguising, or
          decorating. In conversation with their therapist, also a queer artist,
          Downey arrived at the metaphor of a composting worm, working through
          "decomposition and tunneling" to achieve a queer orientation to its
          environment. Their therapist uses the phrase "a radical openness to
          the more-than-human. To materials, sites, elements, to one's own
          bodily and artistic production"
          <a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a> to describe
          Downey's relationship to their surround.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the dynamic of separation that supports the distinctions of
          Western CIS image-making-for example separating figure from ground or
          spectator (demos) from monument (hero)-the composting worm reprocesses
          and regurgitates its surroundings, flattening distinctions. Downey
          refers to the sites of these video performances as "liminal or
          transitional," but it is worth noting that most (factory, museum,
          office building, convent) are also institutional sites. So, in
          digestively meshing with these spaces-infiltrating the apparatus of
          power with a genderqueer body that defies distinctions-Downey gnaws at
          their authority and at their capacity to regulate who or what goes
          where. Downey's reflection that the "composting worm feels very queer
          to me, my trying to find my way in the world and feeling disoriented,
          but doing a kind of creative labor that sustains me. I have no idea if
          it'll provide rich soil for anyone else, but it makes my own life
          livable" reinforces this dynamic of subversion.
          <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be that an element of subversion is needed to gnash and mash
          together the distinctions that define space, and regurgitate it all
          whole. If the worm's re-masticated world is "where physical and
          psychological transformations can synch up,"
          <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a> the result
          may be "a third space." In a recent lexicon about their work and
          longstanding involvement with psychoanalytic process, Downey aligns a
          "third space" with "that which is neither me nor you but the space in
          between or beyond, translocation, transitional space,<strong
          > </strong>liminality, interstitial space, bathrooms and hallways,
          dis/orientated spatial relations, queer phenomenology (Ahmed, 2006),
          how to make space spacious, margins as sites of resistance and radical
          openness (hooks, 1989)"
          <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a> With
          this notion, the exhibition concludes with <em>A Third Space</em>, a
          mostly monochromatic video largely captured from Downey's
          manipulations of black ink and cut out paper shapes, again on an
          overhead projector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luminous Rorschach-like shapes in flux are informed and reformed by a
          voice-over that intelligently fuses psychoanalytic modes of
          association. Pouring fluid on a projector, Downey reenacts the
          processes of making their still image work. It seems a still image is
          always first a moving image. Or, as in the two monumentally scaled
          heads that accompany
          <em>What we came to see</em>, a still image doesn't arrest motion, but
          rather is revealed by movement, like Downey's abrasions that expose
          outlines of statuesque heads with obsessive sanding. Yet the process
          of sanding fuses "closeness" with "erosion,"
          <a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><sup>11</sup></a> so like
          liquid on a projector, the sanded image emerges out of a state of flux
          and eventual disappearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The overhead projector is among Downey's quintessential tools. On the
          one hand, a projector is an almost too-perfect decoy for their
          investments in psychoanalysis. On the other, even if its obsolescence
          suggests regression, it is immediately recognizable as a didactic aid.
          It evokes classroom learning and the dissemination of cultural
          "truths" or norms, when teachers reenact standardized lessons at the
          helm of a class. As a long-term art educator in museum settings,
          Downey is aware of the problematic nature of these forms of
          reenactment that reproduce cultural hegemonies. Yet, as in
          <em>A Third Space</em>, reenactment is also a tool for prizing apart
          the stranglehold such hegemonies have over our self-determination.
          This involves remaking our relationship of self to surround, how we
          position ourselves in spaces and places, and how we learn and
          "un/learn" together. As Downey elaborates, "For me making art is also
          the making and unmaking of parts of myself. Un/learning is
          kinesthetic, requiring an embodied approach to play, a certain amount
          of truth in the nonsense."
          <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><sup>12</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          For Downey, this nonsensical logic of reenactment is summed up in
          Gertrude Stein's insistence that there is no such thing as repetition,
          only difference.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""
            ><sup>13</sup></a
          >
          "This is a reenactment but this time it will be different"<em> </em>is
          a paradoxically true statement because as reenactments, Downey's
          artworks offer experiences of difference. They enact material
          transformations and offer viewers an opportunity to witness change.

          Kerry Downey (b.1979, Ft. Lauderdale) is a genderqueer artist and
          educator based in New York. Downey's interdisciplinary practice
          explores embodied forms of resistance and transformation. They use
          experimental strategies to draw connections between interior worlds
          and sociopolitical landscapes. Downey's lifelong experiences in queer
          and artist collectives, their work with people with dementia and other
          disabilities, and the close overlaps between their art practice and
          teaching, have all utilized art as a strategy for engagement and care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Downey's first major publication,
          <em>We collect together in a net</em>, was published by Wendy's Subway
          in 2019. They have exhibited at the Bureau of General Services-Queer
          Division (New York, NY); Queens Museum (Flushing, NY); Bard CCS /
          Hessel Museum (Annandale, NY); Danspace Project (New York, NY);
          Knockdown Center (Maspeth, NY); Kate Werble (New York, NY); Cooper
          Cole (Toronto, CA); CAVE (Detroit, MI); and Taylor Macklin (Zurich,
          CH). Downey is a recipient of the Joan Mitchell Foundation Emerging
          Artist Grant and Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grant.
          Artist-in-residencies include Skowhegan School of Painting and
          Sculpture, Madison, ME; Triangle Arts Association, Brooklyn, NY; SHIFT
          at EFA Project Space, New York, NY; the Drawing Center's Open
          Sessions, New York, NY; and the Vermont Studio Center, Johnson, VT.
          Downey participated in the Queer|Art|Mentorship program in 2013
          (paired with Angela Dufresne). Their work has been in Artforum, The
          Brooklyn Rail, and The Washington Post.
        </p>
        <p>
          Downey spent over a decade running community-based arts programs at
          The Museum of Modern Art; they have recently taught in the at Rhode
          Island School of Design, Parsons/The New School, City College, and at
          Hunter College. They are a 2022-23 visiting critic/artist in the Art
          Department at Williams College.
